So Mengpo sent you, huh?/I don't want to move on... not yet. I haven't had the perfect cup of coffee./What if I reincarnate/and end up not liking coffee in my next life?!/...The underworld has coffee? Of course it does./Alright, fine... /truth is, I've been here so long, /my obsession conjured up the very coffee I longed for./If you can bring it to me... I'll agree to leave./I want it to be the best coffeeâ€”nothing less.
