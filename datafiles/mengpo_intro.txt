Since you wouldn't wake up, I just gave you a tiny tap~/Not like I'm some kind of violent girl or anything./
... ... ahem Let me reintroduce myself!/I'm Mengpo, the overseer of this underworld!/By the way, Mengpo isn't actually my name./It's just a title I was given a long time ago./When souls arrive in the afterlife, they need to drink my Mengpo Soup /to forget all memories of their previous life /before they can be reincarnated!/(Though... I may have gotten distracted once or twice /and let a few sneak back with their memories.../ just a tiny oversight.)/But before we get to that, I need a little favor./There are a few souls around here who absolutely refuse to move on./
I mean, it's not like we charge rent or anything, but still!/If you could help persuade them before you go, /I'll throw in a little extra luck for your next life~/...Not saying anything? I'll take that as a yes!/Great! I'm counting on you!
