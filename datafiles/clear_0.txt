The moment you take the coffee, /the entire room begins to shake. / You realizeâ€”it was the coffee master's lingering attachment /that held this strange space together. / The aroma of the coffee stirs fragments of memory. / The time spent watching your father cook was always filled with joy. / But now, all that remains is sorrow. / You'll never smell that familiar scent again... / You'll never see that proud expression on his face as he cooked. / You thought you were ready... /but were you, really? / The room collapses.
