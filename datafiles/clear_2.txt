The moment you pick the lotus, the room remains still. /The distant song continues—lonely, yet gentle. /There are people you still wish to see. /There are arms you still wish to run into. /You made it sound cool—/"One life is enough for me."/As if giving up was some aesthetic. /You thought disappearing would be quieter than trying to be understood. /You thought the world didn't want you,/so you left before it could say it out loud. /Your memories are hazy, blurred. /But now you realize—you were wanted. /And you did have reasons to stay.
