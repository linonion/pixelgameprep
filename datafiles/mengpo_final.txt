Thank you for everything. /I guess it's almost time for you to move on, huh? /But before you drink the Meng Po soup, I have one last request. /Like you, I once made a terrible decision. /I've been here so long that my regret took shapeâ€”/and turned into my obsession. /...So I need you to break it for me. /I can't do it myself... /...Yeah. If this obsession disappears, /I think I'll feel a lot lighter. /Maybe I'll finally be able to move on, too.
