The moment you take the manuscript,/the room begins to shake. / You realizeâ€”it was the writer's lingering attachment /that held this strange space together. / The words on the pages bring back fragments of memory. / The moments spent listening to your mother read to you were always filled with joy. / But now, all that remains is sorrow. / You'll never hear that gentle, slightly stern voice again... / You told yourself you were ready for this. / The room collapses.
