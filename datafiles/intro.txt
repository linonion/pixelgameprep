Time feels like it has stopped./You awaken mid-fall, surrounded by pitch-black darkness—/"UMU~ This is the world after death." /A distant female voice drifts through the void./It makes sense somehow./Memories are blurry, fading like smoke./"Hey... hey... can you hear me?"/There's a faint sense that something terrible has happened./"Ugh, still not awake?"/A sudden pain strikes your head—/and just like that, you're pulled back to your senses./Color floods your vision./Standing before you is a pink-haired girl./The world around you remains steeped in darkness./"Welcome to the afterlife, newcomer."
