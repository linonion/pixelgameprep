Sweet one... Mengpo sent you, didn't she? / Hum... sweet, pitiful soul. /How did you end up here, I wonder? / ...You can't remember? / Why I came here? Hum... / Many, many moons ago, there was someone I loved. / But I never had the courage to tell him how I felt. / You see, I was always such a timid thing. / I thought... if love couldn't be returned, it would destroy me. / So I lived a long life... but I always regretted not confessing. / Sweet soul, is that why you're here too? / I can see it... the regret in your eyes. / Hum... go and pick a lotus flower. / It will help you remember the one you loved.
